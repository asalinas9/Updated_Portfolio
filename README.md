# Updated_Portfolio
https://asalinas9.github.io/Updated_Portfolio/

For this Updated Portfolio I based the template from Travis Media.
Made it more custom to my likes: background color, background images, added a few areas based on my personal bio.

# Issues
I had three minor issues with builing the portfolio. First, I was having issues with compiling sass and creating a css file. Then realized I was referencing the wrong folder. Second issue was pertaining to the profile image. I had to find the right size and customize it 3 different ways (depending on the size/slide transition). Last minor issue had to do with the grid boxes under the about me page. Just making them center and adjusting them to the page. 

# Technology Used:
HTML, SASS, Javascript, Node js
