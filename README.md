## Projects added to this updated Portfolio
For this updated Portfolio, I added new projects that includes new skills learned over the past few weeks such as: _MySQL_, _Node Server_, _Handlebars_, _Sequelize_, _Express js_.

# Issues
I had three minor issues with builing the portfolio. First, I was having issues with compiling sass and creating a css file. Then realized I was referencing the wrong folder. Second issue was pertaining to the profile image. I had to find the right size and customize it 3 different ways (depending on the size/slide transition). Last minor issue had to do with the grid boxes under the about me page. Just making them center and adjusting them to the page. 

# Technology Used:
HTML, SASS, Javascript, Node js
