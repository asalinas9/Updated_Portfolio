For this Updated Portfolio I based the Theme from Travis Media.
Made it more custom to my likes: background color, background image, added a few areas based on my personal bio.

Issues
The issues I had where pertaining to the profile image. I had to find the right size and customize it 3 different ways (depending on the size/slide transition). Also, adjusting the grid boxes to be centered under the about me page.
