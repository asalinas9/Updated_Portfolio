				<p>
					For some time now, I have been curious about learning to code. With
					no background experience in this field, I decided to take a Web
					Development BootCamp course at UT Austin. With this new skill set I
					will attain in a few months, it will allow me to broaden my career
					options, as well as, continuing to climb the latter at Apple Inc,
					where I have been working for the past 4 years. I'am from Corpus
					Christ TX, where I attained a BA in International Business from
					Texas A&M Corpus Christi. And, I'am married and have 3 beautiful
					children; Scarlet, Lukas & Oliver.

					What can I say, I'm 100% a family guy. This would be the best hobby
					for me. Spending time with famiy and friends gives me a great joy.
					If you gave me an option of going out or stayin in to grill-out with
					family and friends, I would not hesitate and choose to stay in.

					The second best past time of mine it's sports. I really enjoy
					watching all kinds of sports, but I would say Soccer & Football are
					my top two. Altough, I have been playing Tennis lately, and I gotta
					say, I really enjoy playing as much as watching it too.
